### Algorithmic Image Compression


Using partioning clustering algorithms to compress an image

*The modules, classes, and methods defined in this repo will serve as a basis to additional exploration.*

Upcoming projects that will utilize these methods:
- Trade off analysis between speed and accuracy in image classification tasks
- Image 'preset' color theme extraction and application, to see if images can have a vibe applied to them from an aggregated theme from selected images
- Trade off analysis between speed and accuracy for non-linear dimensionality reduction with ISOMAP
